## Code Challenge 32

## Approach

Needed to create a function that took in two binary trees and returned an array with all the values that were in both trees. I needed to create a function that would count how many nodes were in a tree, so that I could create a hash table that would be the right size. That gave me trouble for awhile but I eventually figured it out. Once the table was created I tried writing a function that would recursively call a method from the table to add all the values of one binary tree to the hash table. However, I whenever I tried to pass the table into the function and call the method it would come back undefined. I'm not sure what is wrong with the function currently will need to follow up.
