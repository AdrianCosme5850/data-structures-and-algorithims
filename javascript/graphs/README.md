# Graphs

## Challenge 35

I had to add a get nodes, size, and get neighbors method to the graphs class.

## Approach

Most of the methods were solved using the built in methods that come with the Map function. It was a bit of a challenge trying to figure out what the correct syntax was, however once I did it all came together rather quickly.
